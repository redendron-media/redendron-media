Integrated branding is the process of creating a unified brand strategy and aligning all aspects of a brand's identity—across marketing, communication, and customer experience—into a cohesive and consistent strategy. This approach ensures that every touch-point reinforces the brand's message, creating a unified and memorable experience for the audience.
